# Extracting-data-variables-from-OpenFoam
For a given simulation on the CFD program OpenFoam, when applying 'integrate Variables' filter over all time steps, it show a data frame with all variables integrated for a given time step, that data frame can be exported to a csv file. Having multiple time steps means exporting multiple csv files, this program reads any requested variable on all data frames and unites them on a single data frame and plots them.  

The data is in two simulations files, one taking into account temperature field (extract_cont) and one without (extract_sinT). The default path in the functions is the one with temperature and when running all the code, extract temperature and plots it; but if is needed to obtain data of other variable, just have to comment the temperature part and uncomment the variableÂ´s code ( Ex. Cinectic Energy 'Ec').
